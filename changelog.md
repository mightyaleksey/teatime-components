## 0.7.0

- *API.* There were some changes in the component's public props, see the changes below.
- *Props filtering.* For now, all the components have props filtering and accept only defined ones and those, which match the regular expression `/^(?:data-|on[A-Z]|style$)/` (`data-*` attrs, event hanlders and style prop).
- *Styles.* Components have the `css` method which retrieves the generated token (base on `size` and `theme` props) for the provided name. `styleName` prop was removed.
