Notes
=====

The small set of notes about common cases that should be tested.


## Common cases

- Rendering with defaults.
- Rendering with all possible prop's values.
- The `onChange` callback interface.
- The (un)controllable behavior.


## Particular cases

- `Focus` `Blur` event handlers for the components (mostly input and textarea).
